Arty (and possibly others):
    * Even if target is blocked by moving obstacle, keep moving towards some point close to it so you can reach it fast once it clears.

Engine:
    * Break out all drawing methods into DrawSurface/Canvas class that will enable
      1. much cleaner/maintainable/swappable drawing code
      2. lets you provide a dummy drawing engine for tests and faster simulations
